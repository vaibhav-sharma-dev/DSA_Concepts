// Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is V‚ÇÅ. A day is record breaking if it satisfies both of the following conditions:

// The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on each of the previous days.

// Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on the following day.

// Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!

// Please help Isyana find out the number of record breaking days.
